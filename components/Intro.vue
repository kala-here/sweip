    <p>Do you ever wonder where those personal-work-notes should live? You open your notes app on your computer only to wonder… will I remember to export these whenever I leave?</p>

    <p>Will I remember they exists… will I look in my google drive for them or..?</p>

    <p>This is your designated space. With applied AI, this app curates your proudest and most challenging moments of day-to-day work life. With quarterly check ins, you can recap what’s gone on. If you choose to keep a daily diary here, no one will stop you. Filter your writtens by project, effort, time, complexity, technologies… etc.</p>

    <p>You’re amazing. Your accomplishments are amazing. You just need to remember them.</p>
